**PSU Environmental Science - Multivariate Analysis Term Project**

- [x] Github setup instructions:  
- 1.  *Click on the "Fork" icon at the top of the page.  This creates a copy (clone) of the master that is now your repository.*
- 2.  *Copy the HTTPS clone URL from the box next to your repository on the right. Check the link, it should have your Github user name in it.*
- 3. *Download Git for your operating system:  http://www.git-scm.com/downloads. This program allows R to interface with Github.*
- 3. *In R, select new project, then version control, then Git.  Here is where you will paste the link from the Github clone.*
- 4. *Step three will automaticly copy all files into your new R directory on your PC.*
- You are all set, now you can start changing your script.  When you have made some changes you feel good about, "commit" saves changes to your project file on your system.  You can now "Push" those changes to repository or "Pull" from repository changes that others have made to your forked repository. Select the "Watch" icon at top to recieve automatic updates on the project.
- [x] Meet with group and select variables
- [x] Setup github repository for version control
- [ ] Check assumptions for PCA
- [ ] Run PCA
- [ ] Compare variances from biplot with cor.matrix, and corelatin matrix
- [ ] **Redundancy Matrix Analysis (RMA)**
- **Multiple linear regression followed by a PCA of the table of fitted values**
- 1. Regsress each (centered) Y-variable on explanatory table X adn compute the fitted (y-hat) and residuals (y-res) vectors.  Assemble all y-hat vectors into a matrix **Y-hat** of fitted values.
- 2. Compute a PCA of the matrix **Y-hat** of fitted values (produces a vector of canonical eigenvalues adn a matrix **U** of canical eigenvectors.
- 3.  Use matrix **U** to compute two types of ordination site scores (*Analysis produces constrained and unconstrained site scores*)
- [ ] MANOVA
- [ ] Report findings - Term paper
- [ ] Presentation
